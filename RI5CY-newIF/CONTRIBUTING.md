## Getting Started
The [OpenHW Work Flow](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-docs/blob/master/verif/Common/OpenHWGroup_WorkFlow.pdf) document
is required reading.  You will find information about the implementation and usage of the CORE-V verification environments
in the [Verification Strategy](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-docs/blob/master/verif/Common/OpenHWGroup_CORE-V_Verif_Strategy.pdf).

2. Clone repository: `git clone https://github.com/[your_github_username]/cv32e40p`
3. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b <my_branch>.`<br> Please uniquify your branch name.  See the [Git Cheats](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-verif/blob/master/GitCheats.md)
for a useful nominclature.
4. Make your edits...
5. Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'Add some feature' -s`<br>...take note of that **-s**, it's important!
